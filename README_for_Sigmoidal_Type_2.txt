In the Type-2 sigmoidal function, the coefficients a, b, c, and d, is the vertical shift, indicating how much the curve is shifted vertically, b is the scaling factor, controlling the overall amplitude of the curve, c is the horizontal shift, determining the midpoint of the curve along the x-axis, a,d d is the slope parameter, influencing the steepness of the curve. 
The corresponding mathematical equation is given by:

y = a + b/(1 + exp(x-c/d))
