In the Type-1 sigmoidal function, the coefficients a, b, c, and d, gives the idea on the minimum or lower asymptote point, maximum or the upper asymptote point, steepness of the slope and the
value at which the curve undergoes steepest change. The corresponding mathematical equation is given by:

y = a + (b-a)/(1 + exp(c*(x-d)))
